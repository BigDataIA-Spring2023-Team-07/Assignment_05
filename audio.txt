We are just seconds away from the March employment report and it's not like we're not going to be able to watch the reaction. The stock market might be closed, but we've got this futures equity futures and bond futures. So obviously we needed to be here. We need to see exactly what the reaction is. There are equity futures all in the red just slightly this morning. And maybe more importantly, let's look at at the 10 year, two year. I'd have that ready to go. There you go. Right now. 10 year, three thirty six time for the report. Rick Santelli, what's the number? Yes, the March jobs report, everybody's expecting a monitoring the wires that should be hitting. And here it comes. Expecting two hundred and thirty thousand nonfarm jobs, two hundred and thirty six thousand, two hundred and thirty six thousand. Very close to expectations. And if you consider manufacturing, manufacturing was down one thousand less than the four to five thousand many were expecting. Let's get into the meat of this, shall we? The unemployment rate drops from three point six to three point five, three point five. The best it's been or the lowest I should say it's been was three point four. That was January. Unless there's any longer term revisions up three tenths, up three tenths on average hourly earnings. That's a month over month level that follows up two tenths and exactly as expected. And if you take a longer view year over year on average hourly earnings, it's up four point two percent, one tenth lighter than expectations. Four tenths lighter than the rear view mirror at four point six and four point two is the lowest level actually post covid. That's the lowest post covid level. In advent, July of twenty two at four point three, we usurp that. That is significant. And if you look at the average weekly hours per employee, thirty four point four, that's one tenth lighter than expectations, one tenth lighter than the rear view mirror. And this is also equal to the shortest week, which was December of twenty two. And it's been steadily moving down. Many employers probably don't feel like they need to overwork or get more out of every worker because it's more about layoffs and slowdowns at this point. Labor force participation. This is a big huge, a new post covid high. Sixty two point six, sixty two point six, which is exactly what it was in March of twenty twenty. Right on the cusp of covid. It was sixty three point three in February, just before covid. The underemployment rate or you six six point seven that follows six point eight. The best or the lowest it's been a six point five. And like the general unemployment rate that was in December, the last month of last year, we see that the interest rates, well, they have moved a bit higher. The cash market actually is open till noon and yields have just popped to about three thirty six. But the futures at the CME have also popped out. Futures are a bit higher. The markets are going to be thin. Many customers aren't going to be able to move any huge amount of size. But this report is generally generally about as expected. The two month revision was worth seventeen thousand. We took away seventeen thousand. And if we put this in the context of yesterday's big revisions, benchmark revisions on initial and continuing claims, my feeling is the Fed ought to be paying a lot more attention to some of the issues that may be showing a slowdown or at least a less tight labor market. And quickly here, I don't mean to take too much time. We're seeing revisions now. I said minus seventeen thousand. Let's put a face on that. So last month, three hundred eleven thousand now moves to three hundred and twenty six thousand, which means the bulk of those revisions were in the previous month.
